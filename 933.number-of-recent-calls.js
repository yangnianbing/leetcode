 * algorithms
 * Easy (67.12%)
 * Total Accepted:    11.5K
 * Total Submissions: 17.1K
 * Testcase Example:  '["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"]\n[[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]'
 *
 * Write a class RecentCounter to count recent requests.
 * 
 * It has only one method: ping(int t), where t represents some time in
 * milliseconds.
 * 
 * Return the number of pings that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago
 * until now.
 * 
 * Any ping with time in [t - 3000, t] will count, including the current ping.
 * 
 * It is guaranteed that every call to ping uses a strictly larger value of t
 * than before.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs =
 * [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
 * Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Each test case will have at most 10000 calls to ping.
 * Each test case will call ping with strictly increasing values of t.
 * Each call to ping will have 1 <= t <= 10^9.
 * 
 *
