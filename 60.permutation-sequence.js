 * Testcase Example:  '3\n3'
 *
 * The set [1,2,3,...,n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
 * 
 * By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the
 * following sequence for n = 3:
 * 
 * 
 * "123"
 * "132"
 * "213"
 * "231"
 * "312"
 * "321"
 * 
 * 
 * Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * Given n will be between 1 and 9 inclusive.
 * Given k will be between 1 and n! inclusive.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 3, k = 3
 * Output: "213"
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, k = 9
 * Output: "2314"
