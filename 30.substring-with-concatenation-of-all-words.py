# Testcase Example:  '"barfoothefoobarman"\n["foo","bar"]'
#
# You are given a string, s, and a list of words, words, that are all of the
# same length. Find all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a
# concatenation of each word in words exactly once and without any intervening
# characters.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input:
# ⁠ s = "barfoothefoobarman",
# ⁠ words = ["foo","bar"]
# Output: [0,9]
# Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoor" and "foobar"
# respectively.
# The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input:
# ⁠ s = "wordgoodgoodgoodbestword",
# ⁠ words = ["word","good","best","word"]
# Output: []
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
# @param {string} s
# @param {string[]} words
# @return {integer[]}
